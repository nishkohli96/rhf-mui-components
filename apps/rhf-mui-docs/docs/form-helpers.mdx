# Form Helpers

Starting from version 2, a new module named `form-helpers` has been introduced
in this package. This module provides internal utility functions designed to
simplify development, saving both time and effort for developers.

Currently, it exports a single function, detailed below.

## fieldNameToLabel

This function generates a user-friendly label for the form field based on its
`fieldName` prop, eliminating the need for the developer to explicitly
provide the `label` prop, unless required.

**Importing the Function**

```js
import { fieldNameToLabel } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/form-helpers';
```

**Function Signature**

```ts
function fieldNameToLabel(fieldName: string): string;
```

### Usage

This function can be extremely useful for generating human-readable validation
messages for your fields, saving you the effort of manually crafting a custom
sentence for each field validation. It:

1. Converts camelCase and snake_case into words.
2. Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
3. Handles abbreviations when generating the field label.

### Example

**Input and Output**

```js
import { fieldNameToLabel } from '@your-package-name/form-helpers';

const label1 = fieldNameToLabel('firstName');    // Output: 'First Name'
const label2 = fieldNameToLabel('email_address'); // Output: 'Email Address'
const label3 = fieldNameToLabel('IMDBRating');   // Output: 'IMDB Rating'
```
