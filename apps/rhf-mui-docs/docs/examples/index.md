# Examples

This section has various examples of all the form components that are available in the package. The different variations of each component have been presented to the reader in an interactive form which shows the complete form state, ie., values and errors during user input.

We also have covered form validation using libraries like [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi), [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup), [class-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-validator) etc. which is possible in [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) using [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) package. Each example will also have link to the source code, which can be viewed in the Github repository.
