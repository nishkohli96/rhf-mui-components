# Customization

By now, you should have a solid understanding of the customization options 
available for all components. This section provides even more flexibility, 
enabling you to style components globally, eliminating the need to 
duplicate code across your application.

All components share at least two common props: [FormLabel](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/form-label/) 
and [FormHelperText](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/form-helper-text/). Components like checkboxes or switches 
also include a [FormControlLabel](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/form-control-label/). 
These can be preconfigured to apply uniform styles across all components. 
Additionally, there's an option to customize the `dateAdapter` for 
date and time pickers, with `AdapterDayjs` set as the default, following 
[MUI's recommendation](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#recommended-library).

### ConfigProvider & DefaultRHFMuiConfig

To streamline customization, the library provides a `ConfigProvider` component
and the default values in `DefaultRHFMuiConfig` object, allowing you to 
override or extend the default values for components globally.

You can either apply these customizations across all forms by initializing 
`ConfigProvider` at the root level of your application or use it within a 
specific form as a parent component.

Below are the default values for customization:

<DefaultConfigValuesTable />

**All of these props are optional**.

### Usage

```
import { ConfigProvider } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components';
```

Override the default `FormLabel` and `FormHelperText` values by providing
the desired values in `defaultFormLabelSx` and `defaultFormHelperTextSx` props
which accepts all valid values in the [`sx` prop](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/#the-sx-prop).

You can also specify a different `dateAdapter` for date and time pickers. 
For a full list of available date adapters, see the 
[MUI date library options](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#date-library).
Please do install the npm package of the corresponding date library.

```jsx
<ConfigProvider
  defaultFormLabelSx={{ color: '#007bff' }}
  defaultFormControlLabelSx={{ color: '#ea3677', mr: '1rem' }}
  defaultFormHelperTextSx={{ mt: '0.75rem' }}
  dateAdapter={AdapterMoment}
>
  <form>
    {/* Form content */}
  </form>
</ConfigProvider>
```

For detailed usage of `ConfigProvider` and extending an existing component,
refer to [this example](https://rhf-mui-components-examples.netlify.app/examples/customization).
