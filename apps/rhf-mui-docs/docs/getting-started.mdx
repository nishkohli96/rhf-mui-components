# Getting Started


To optimize bundle size and enable developers to install only the packages they need,
this package is split into independent modules. You can explore the folder structure
and its contents by expanding the tree nodes.

<FolderStructure />

- [Config](./customization) - Provides a Context Provider to set default styles 
for all components and configure the `dateAdapter` for date and time pickers.
- [Mui](./components/mui) - Includes core Material-UI components such as TextField, 
Select, and others.
- [Mui-Pickers](./components/mui-pickers) - Contains Material-UI date and 
time picker components.
- [Misc](./components/misc) -  Features external form components, such as the 
rich text editor, that are not part of Material-UI.

To minimize the bundle size, this package includes both named and default exports 
within each module. Similar to Material-UI, developers are encouraged to use 
default import syntax to [reduce bundle size](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/).

The type for each component can also be imported to modify or customize an 
existing component.  

## Working

Each component requires a set of common props, detailed in the table below.
Some props might be specific to a component, say [DatePicker](../components/mui-pickers/RHFDatePicker#api), 
and can be viewed in the documentation page for the respective component.
The properties marked as required are mandatory for the components that
require it.

_You can also import the interface of each component, like `RHFDatePickerProps`
to extend an existing component or create another reusable component from it._
