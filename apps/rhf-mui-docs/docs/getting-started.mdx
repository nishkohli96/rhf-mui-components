# Getting Started

To minimize the application bundle size and allow developers to install 
only the necessary packages, the package is divided into the following 
independent modules:

```
📁 @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
└── config
└── 📁 mui
    └── RHFTextField
    └── RHFPasswordInput
    └── RHFSelect
    └── RHFNativeSelect
    └── RHFCheckbox
    └── RHFCheckboxGroup
    └── RHFRadioGroup
    └── RHFSlider
    └── RHFSwitch
    └── RHFRating
└── 📁 mui-pickers
    └── RHFDatePicker
    └── RHFTimePicker
    └── RHFDateTimePicker
└── 📁 misc
    └── RHFColorPicker
    └── RHFRichTextEditor
```

- [Config](./customization) - Provides a Context Provider to set default styles 
for all components or configure the `dateAdapter` for date and time pickers.
- [Mui](./components/mui) - Includes core Material-UI components such as TextField, 
Select, and others.
- [Mui-Pickers](./components/mui-pickers) - Contains Material-UI date and 
time picker components.
- [Misc](./components/misc) -  Features external form components, such as the 
rich text editor, that are not part of Material-UI.

To minimize the bundle size, this package includes both named and default exports 
within each module. Similar to Material-UI, developers are encouraged to use 
default import syntax to [reduce bundle size](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/).

The type for each component can also be imported to modify or customize an 
existing component.  

## Working

Each component requires a set of common props, detailed in the table below.
Some props might be specific to a component, say [DatePicker](../components/mui-pickers/RHFDatePicker#api), 
and can be viewed in the documentation page for the respective component.

_You can also import the interface of each component, like `RHFDatePickerProps`
to extend an existing component or create another reusable component from it._
