# Introduction
Design forms within minutes by using the most popular form library [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
with [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) using a suite of reusable and customizable Mui components,
thus helping you reduce code duplicacy and providing the flexibility to create form fields as per your website's design.

## Working
Each component requires some common props which are listed in the table
below along with their description. Some props might be specific to a 
material-ui component, say [DatePicker](../components/pickers/DatePicker#api), 
and can be viewed in the documentation page for the respective component.
