# Introduction
Easily design forms in minutes using the popular [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
library alongside [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).
This package provides a suite of **20+ reusable and customizable components**, specifically designed
to simplify form creation. Each component handles internal form logic and UI rendering seamlessly,
minimizing code duplication and empowering developers to style form fields in alignment with their
website's design guidelines.

You can also find some additional components in this package like **color-picker** and 
**rich text editor** that are not currently a part of Material-UI,
but will come in handy when you need them. More components will be added in the future based on the feedback from the 
community. You are most welcome to raise a feature request or suggest 
bug fix by contacting the author of this package. 


## Installation

To get started, install [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) and [@nish1896/rhf-mui-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nish1896/rhf-mui-components).

```
npm i react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```
```
yarn add react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```

Ensure that you also have installed [Material UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material). 
If not, refer to the [installation guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/). 
For datepickers, follow the [installation guide](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/) 
to install [@mui/x-date-pickers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-date-pickers).
The form components are compatible with [v5](https://v5.mui.com/material-ui/), 
[v6](https://v6.mui.com/material-ui/) and [v7](https://mui.com/material-ui/) of material-ui.

**Optional** : If you are using a third party library for form validation, say [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi), make
sure to install its npm package along with the [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) package.

```
npm i @hookform/resolvers joi

```
yarn add @hookform/resolvers joi
