# Introduction
Easily design forms in minutes using the popular [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
library alongside [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
This package offers a suite of reusable and customizable Mui components,
reducing code duplication and providing the flexibility to style form fields 
according to your website's design.

## Installation

To get started, install [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) and [@nish1896/rhf-mui-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nish1896/rhf-mui-components).

```
npm i react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```
```
yarn add react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```

**Optional** : If you are using a third party for form validation, say [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi), make
sure to install its npm package along with the [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) package.

```
npm i @hookform/resolvers
```
```
yarn add @hookform/resolvers
```

## Working
Each component requires a set of common props, detailed in the table below.
Some props might be specific to a component, say [DatePicker](../components/pickers/DatePicker#api), 
and can be viewed in the documentation page for the respective component.
