# Introduction
Easily design forms in minutes using the popular [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
library alongside [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).
This package offers a suite of reusable and customizable MUI components,
reducing code duplication and providing the flexibility to style form fields 
according to your website's design. 

You can also find some additional components like **color-picker** and 
**rich text editor** that are not currently a part of Material-UI. More 
components will be added in the future based on the feedback from the 
community. You are most welcome to raise a feature request or suggest 
bug fix by contacting the author of this package. 


## Installation

To get started, install [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) and [@nish1896/rhf-mui-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nish1896/rhf-mui-components).

```
npm i react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```
```
yarn add react-hook-form @nish1896/rhf-mui-components
```

Ensure that you also have installed [Material UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material). 
If not, refer to the [installation guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/). 
For datepickers, follow the [installation guide](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/) 
to install [@mui/x-date-pickers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-date-pickers).
The form components are compatible with both [v5](https://v5.mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) 
and [v6](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) of material-ui.

**Optional** : If you are using a third party library for form validation, say [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi), make
sure to install its npm package along with the [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers) package.

```
npm i @hookform/resolvers joi
```
```
yarn add @hookform/resolvers joi
```
