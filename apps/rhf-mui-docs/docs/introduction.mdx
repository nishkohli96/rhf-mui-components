# Introduction
This library makes easier to integrate [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) by providing a suite of reusable and customizable Mui components, thus helping you reduce code duplicacy and providing the flexibility to create form fields as per your website's design.

## Working
Each component requires some common props which are listed in the table
below along with their description. Remaining component props include the props specific to that material-ui component, say Textfield, and can be viewed in the documentation page for that component.
