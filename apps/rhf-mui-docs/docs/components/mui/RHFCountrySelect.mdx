# RHFCountrySelect

**RHFCountrySelect** leverages the [Autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/) 
component from Material-UI to enable users to select one or more countries
from a comprehensive list of 250 options. It offers flexibility in retrieving
the selected country's value as its name, ISO code, or ISO3 code. Additionally,
each option is displayed with the respective country's flag, enhancing the
component's visual appeal and user experience.

### Usage

```js
import RHFCountrySelect, {
  RHFCountrySelectProps,
  CountryISO,
  CountryDetails,
  countryList
} from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/mui/country-select';
```

```jsx
<RHFCountrySelect
  fieldName="nationality"
  control={control}
  errorMessage={errors?.nationality?.message}
/>
```

Each option in the list of 250 countries is represented as an object
structured as follows:

```js
{
  name: 'India',
  iso: 'IN',
  iso3: 'IND',
  emoji: 'ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³'
}
```

By default, the `iso` key is used to return the value of the selected
option(s), offering a compact and consistent identifier. The iso key is
strongly typed as `CountryISO`, ensuring type safety and consistency in
integration. Additionally, users can choose to retrieve the **_name_** or
**_iso3_** value(s) of the selected option(s) by specifying the desired key
through the `valueKey` prop, providing flexibility to suit various use cases.

For developers seeking access to all available country data,
the complete list of countries is provided via the `countryList` export
from this module.

The following code snippet demonstrates an advanced use case where users
can select multiple countries by their names from a predefined list of
country options. To improve usability, a set of preferred countries is
prominently displayed at the top of the dropdown. This prioritization
ensures frequently chosen options are easily accessible, streamlining
the selection process.

```js
/* Logic for filtering countries */
const filteredCountries = countryList.filter(
  country => ['IN', 'US', 'AU', 'FI', 'UA', 'CN', 'GB', 'JP', 'VN'].includes(country.iso)
);
```

```jsx
<RHFCountrySelect
  fieldName="dreamDestinations"
  control={control}
  valueKey="name"
  preferredCountries={['IN', 'AU', 'JP']}
  countries={filteredCountries}
  multiple
  errorMessage={errors?.dreamDestinations?.message}
/>
```
