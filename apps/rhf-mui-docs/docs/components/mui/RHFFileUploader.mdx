# RHFFileUploader

<AvailabilityBanner componentName="RHFFileUploader" version="2.1" />

**RHFFileUploader** component is a flexible and easy-to-use file input field built
supporting both single and multi-file uploads, optional file type and size validation,
and customizable UI elements such as the upload button and file list items.

## Usage

```js
import RHFFileUploader, { RHFFileUploaderProps, FileUploadError } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/mui/file-uploader';
```

Here’s a basic example of the component configured to accept a single file:

```jsx
<RHFFileUploader
  fieldName="resume"
  control={control}
  errorMessage={errors?.resume?.message}
/>
```

A file object has the following properties:

```js
{
  lastModified: 1738870405923,
  lastModifiedDate: "Fri Feb 07 2025 01:03:25 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)",
  name: "Picture.png",
  size: 860146,
  type: "image/png",
  webkitRelativePath: ""
}
```
When uploading files via an API, the files are sent within a **FormData** object.
On a Node.js Express server, you can handle this incoming data using the [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) middleware.
Here’s an [example](https://github.com/nishkohli96/client-server-libs/blob/main/apps/express-server/src/routes/file/controller.ts)
illustrating how to handle file uploads with Multer in Express, where I have used
various [file upload middlewares](https://github.com/nishkohli96/client-server-libs/blob/main/apps/express-server/src/middleware/file-uploader.ts)
to store data in a dedicated folder based on certain conditions.

```ts
async function onFormSubmit(formValues: FormSchema) {
  const formData = new FormData();
  const { resume, pictures } = formValues;

  /* resume can be null, hence handle the null check */
  resume && formData.append('resume', resume);

  Array.isArray(pictures) && pictures.forEach(file => {
    formData.append('pictures', file);
  });
  await sendFormData(url, formData);
}
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced scenarios, `RHFFileUploader` can be configured to:
- Accept **multiple files**.
- Restrict file types using the `accept` prop, for example, to allow only images (`image/*`).
- Limit the maximum number of valid files a user can upload
- Use a **custom upload button** to match your design requirements.
- Customize the **display of uploaded files**, including file names, sizes, and a remove button.

```jsx
<RHFFileUploader
  fieldName="pictures"
  control={control}
  multiple
  accept="image/*"
  showFileSize
  maxFiles={3}
  maxSize={5 * 1024 * 1024}
  label={
    <Typography color="secondary" sx={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>
      <CloudUploadIcon />
      {` Upload Photos`}
    </Typography>
  }
  renderUploadButton={fileInput => (
    <div style={{ width: '200px' }}>
      <IconButton component="label" tabIndex={-1}>
        <UploadFileIcon />
        {fileInput}
      </IconButton>
    </div>
  )}
  renderFileItem={(file, index) => (
    <Typography variant="body2">
      {index + 1}. {file.name}
      {getFileSize(file.size, { precision: 2 })}
    </Typography>
  )}
  onUploadError={(errors, rejectedFiles) => {
    alert(`${rejectedFiles.length} file(s) were rejected as ${errors.join(' ,')}`)
  }}
/>
```

The `renderUploadButton` prop allows you to render a **custom upload button**,
with the `fileInput` (the hidden file input) provided as its child.

Similarly, the `renderFileItem` prop lets you customize how each uploaded
file is displayed in the file list.

:::note
Make sure to add the `component="label"` prop to your custom
`Button` or `IconButton` component to ensure the file input is triggered correctly,
as file dialogs can only be opened via label elements or direct interaction with file inputs.

Additionally, add `tabIndex={-1}` to the button to exclude it from the
tab order, keeping focus management limited to the hidden file input
itself for better accessibility.
