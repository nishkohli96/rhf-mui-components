# Date & Time Pickers

Many forms require date or time input from users, such as entering a date of birth. Thus this package would have been incomplete without these date and time input components.

The date and time pickers provided are derived from [Mui X Pickers](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/). Please follow the [installation guide](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/) and review the [base concepts](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/)  to begin integrating these components. Each picker component comes wrapped with a [LocalizationProvider](https://mui.com/x/api/date-pickers/localization-provider/).

:::info
This package is compatible with Mui X Pickers **v6**, **v7** and **v8**.
:::

To use date and time pickers, you need to provide a default `dateAdapter` 
using the [ConfigProvider](../../customization) component. This can be done at the root level of your application, especially if it includes multiple forms with date and time pickers. To view the list of available libraries, refer [this page](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#available-libraries).

```jsx
<ConfigProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
  <form>
    {/* form content */}
  </form>
</ConfigProvider>
```

The recommended `dateAdapter` library is [dayjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs), so ensure you have it installed along with the [@mui/x-date-pickers package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-date-pickers).
To know why, read [here](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#recommended-library).

```
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers
npm install dayjs
```
```
yarn add @mui/x-date-pickers
yarn add dayjs
```
