# RHFRichTextEditor

`RHFRichTextEditor` is a powerful and flexible rich text editor designed for 
content creation within forms. It allows users to format text with features 
like _**bold**_, _**italics**_, _**lists**_, _**links**_, _**images**_, 
and more, making it suitable for blog posts, comments, or any content 
requiring rich formatting. This component is built on top of 
[CkEditor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/index.html),
a highly customizable editor that supports advanced features like 
`codeBlocks`, `findAndReplace`, `tables`, and more.

```
npm i ckeditor5 @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react
```

```
yarn add ckeditor5 @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react
```

## Usage

```js
import RHFRichTextEditor, { RHFRichTextEditorProps, DefaultEditorConfig } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/misc/rich-text-editor';
```

```jsx
<RHFRichTextEditor
  fieldName='bio'
  value={getValues('bio')}
  setValue={setValue}
/>
```

To reorder formatting options or add advanced features, you can provide
a custom configuration via the `editorConfig` prop, or override the existing
configuration by modifying the `DefaultEditorConfig` object. You can check the 
[default configuration here](https://github.com/nishkohli96/rhf-mui-components/blob/main/packages/rhf-mui-components/src/components/miscellaneous/rich-text-editor/config.ts).

To customize editor theme, check the [theme customization guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/deep-dive/ui/theme-customization.html).

For advanced features like **findAndReplace**, **inserting images**, 
**markdown support**, and **word count**, refer to [this example](https://github.com/nishkohli96/react-libs/blob/main/src/pages/rte/CkEditorAdvanced.tsx). 
For a full list of available CKEditor features, visit the [CKEditor documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html).

### Alternatives
I chose CKEditor for its advanced features, customization options and
support for multiple languages. Although the documentation can be overwhelming, 
I've provided both basic and advanced configuration options for this component. 
If you're looking for a simpler solution, you can consider implementing 
[mui-rte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-rte).
