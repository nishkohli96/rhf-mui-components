# RHFRichTextEditor

**RHFRichTextEditor** is a powerful and flexible rich text editor designed for 
content creation within forms. It allows users to format text with features 
like _**bold**_, _**italics**_, _**lists**_, _**links**_, _**images**_, 
and more, making it suitable for blog posts, comments, or any content 
requiring rich formatting. This component is built on top of 
[CkEditor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/index.html),
a highly customizable editor that supports advanced features like 
`codeBlocks`, `findAndReplace`, `tables`, and more.

:::warning
The latest versions of [CkEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) require a paid license key.
Therefore, we will use the free version of this package.

To use the latest version, refer to the [Use Latest Version section](#with-latest-version).
:::

```
npm i ckeditor5@43.0.0 @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react@9.0.0
```

```
yarn add ckeditor5@43.0.0 @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react@9.0.0
```

## Usage

```js
import RHFRichTextEditor, { RHFRichTextEditorProps, DefaultEditorConfig } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/misc/rich-text-editor';
```

```jsx
<RHFRichTextEditor
  fieldName='bio'
  control={control}
  errorMessage={errors?.bio?.message}
/>
```

To reorder formatting options or add advanced features, you can provide
a custom configuration via the `editorConfig` prop, or override the existing
configuration by modifying the `DefaultEditorConfig` object. You can check the 
[default configuration here](https://github.com/nishkohli96/rhf-mui-components/blob/main/packages/rhf-mui-components/src/components/miscellaneous/rich-text-editor/config.ts).

To customize editor theme, check the [theme customization guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/deep-dive/ui/theme-customization.html).

For advanced features like **findAndReplace**, **inserting images**, 
**markdown support**, and **word count**, refer to [this example](https://github.com/nishkohli96/react-libs/blob/main/src/pages/rte/CkEditorAdvanced.tsx). 
For a full list of available CKEditor features, visit the [CKEditor documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/index.html).

:::note
If your website supports both light and dark themes, styling `CKEditor5` for theme switching
can be challenging, as the editor doesn't dynamically adapt to theme changes once rendered.
To address this, you can override the editor's CSS based on the active theme by
referring [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nishkohli96/cc26a1b6e8e372dad1be7c5cfa42d9c5).

You may also refer [CkEditor5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/index.html)
for a better understanding.

### With Latest Version

The latest version of **CKEditor5** requires a paid license key. To continue accessing the
newest features of the editor while preserving the underlying form logic, update your code
as follows:â€‹

1.  **Obtain a License Key**: Acquire a commercial license key from the [CKEditor Pricing Page](https://ckeditor.com/pricing/).

2.  **Update Your CKEditor 5 Configuration**: Incorporate the licenseKey into your editor configuration:

    ```jsx
    import RHFRichTextEditor, { DefaultEditorConfig } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components/misc/rich-text-editor';

    <RHFRichTextEditor
      fieldName='bio'
      control={control}
      editorConfig={{
        licenseKey: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
        ...DefaultEditorConfig,
      }}
      errorMessage={errors?.bio?.message}
    />
    ```

    Replace **'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'** with the license key you've obtained. Additionally you can 
    also configure your own [editor settings](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/setup/configuration.html#configuring-editor-settings) 
    in favor of the default configuration.

## Alternatives
I chose CKEditor for its advanced features, customization options and
support for multiple languages. Although the documentation can be overwhelming, 
I've provided both basic and advanced configuration options for this component. 
If you're looking for a simpler solution, you can consider implementing 
[mui-rte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-rte).
