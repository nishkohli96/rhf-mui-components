# Miscellaneous Components

**These components are not part of the [Material-UI component list](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/) and are derived from external components published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).** 

You will need to install the corresponding npm package for the derived 
component separately or create your own component if the existing component 
doesn't meet your requirements. 

We welcome suggestions for improving existing implementations. 
Feel free to raise a PR with your implementation of a missing 
component, thus helping other developers as well.

:::warning
It is highly recommended to use the default import for each component in 
this module to avoid the "Package NOT FOUND" error during runtime.

Please throughly read the documentation of the respective packages, 
including the props required by them.
:::

Alternative packages with similar functionality to the existing components 
are suggested for developer convenience. However, you will need to create 
your own custom implementation to integrate these alternative packages.

As always, link to the source code will be attached in the demo example 
for each component.
