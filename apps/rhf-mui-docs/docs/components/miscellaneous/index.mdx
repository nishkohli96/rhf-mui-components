# Miscellaneous Components

**These components are not part of the [Material-UI component list](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/) and are derived from external components published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).** 

You will need to install the corresponding npm package for the derived component separately or create your own component if the existing component doesn't meet your requirements.

_Please throughly read the documentation of the respective packages, including the props required by them._

As always, link to the source code will be attached in the demo example for each component.
