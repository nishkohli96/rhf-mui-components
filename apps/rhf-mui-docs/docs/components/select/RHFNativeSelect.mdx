# RHFNativeSelect

`RHFNativeSelect` extends Mui [NativeSelect](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-select/#native-select) which
allow users to select one or more options for a particular question.
One significant advantage of using this component is its ability to _**accept both
array as well as object-array values**_, thus reducing the effort of the developer to
write a custom logic to render options, especially when the label and value of
the option are different.

### Usage

```js
import { RHFNativeSelect, RHFNativeSelectProps } from "@nish1896/rhf-mui-components";
```

```jsx
<RHFNativeSelect
  fieldName="color"
  register={register}
  options={["Red", "Blue", "Orange"]}
  errorMessage={errors?.color?.message}
/>

/* With an array of objects as options */
<RHFNativeSelect
  fieldName="country"
  register={register}
  options={[
    { code: "AUS", country: "Australia" },
    { code: "UAE", country: "United Arab Emirates" },
    { code: "IN", country: "India" },
  ]}
  labelKey="country"
  valueKey="code"
  errorMessage={errors?.country?.message}
/>
```
