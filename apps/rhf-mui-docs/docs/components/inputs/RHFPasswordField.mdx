# RHFPasswordField

`RHFPasswordField` is a customized version of Mui [TextField](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-text-field/),
which as the name suggests, will be mainly used for signup and login forms. By using this component in your
authentication form, users will be able to toggle password visibility while filling up their credentials.

### Usage

```js
import { RHFPasswordField, RHFPasswordFieldProps } from "@nish1896/rhf-mui-components";
```

`RHFPasswordField` also requires a bare minimum of 3-4 props to render a fully functional form-field.

```jsx
<RHFPasswordField
  fieldName="password"
  register={register}
  errorMessage={errors?.password?.message}
/>
```
