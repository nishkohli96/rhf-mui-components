# RHFRating

Ratings provide insight regarding others' opinions and experiences, and can
allow the user to submit a rating of their own. `RHFRating` extends the 
[Rating](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) component,
so it accepts almost all props of `Rating` and can be customized accordingly!

### Usage

```js
import { RHFRating, RHFRatingProps } from '@nish1896/rhf-mui-components';
```

```jsx
<RHFRating
  fieldName="rating"
  control={control}
  errorMessage={errors?.rating?.message}
/>
```

### Examples
- [RHFRating](../../examples/switch-slider-rating)
- [Rating](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/)
- [Complete Form](../../examples/complete-form)
